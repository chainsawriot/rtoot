Interact with the [mastodon API](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/) from R

*(There is already such a package available [here](https://github.com/ThomasChln/mastodon), but it doesn't seem to be maintained)*

## Installation

You can install the development version of rtoot like so:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("schochastics/rtoot")
```

## Roadmap

This package is in a very early stage. Use at own risk (API might still change)
